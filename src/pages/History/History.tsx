        "The movement was championed by Late Bishop Amos Nwokenna, who at that time was only a Christian brother. Many people gave their lives to Jesus — boys, girls, men, women, and children. Because of their tireless passion, the gospel spread from marketplaces to schools and village squares, breaking idols, shrines, and charms. It was indeed a gospel revolution across Etiti and its environs.",
        "Bishop Amos Nwokenna once said, “We never thought of starting a church, because we were all in our different denominations. But every Sunday afternoon, after our various church services, we all came together and had fellowship.”",
        "As more people joined the fellowship, they faced severe persecution from denominational groups who accused them of spreading strange doctrines — especially concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Yet, they stood firm, filled with the Holy Ghost, speaking with new tongues, and witnessing mighty signs and wonders.",
